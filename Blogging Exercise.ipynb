    "A great way to build your skills, portfolio, and online presence as a data scientist is to regularly play with new datasets and publish interesting observations you have made. Every Monday afternoon, you'll be examining a dataset of your choosing in order to practice this skill. Below are a series of questions to get you started. You may use this notebook as a template to complete the exercise every week.\n",
